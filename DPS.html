        <p>
            &nbsp;Education has been undergoing transformation ever since its inception. At DPS too, we keep ourselves apprised and keep pace with the ever &nbsp;changing demands and aims of education. We realise that education is not just STEAM it is in fact the locomotive that keeps our lives moving and &nbsp;keeps us motivated. Therefore we aim to make the school a fun experience for the child keeping in mind the fact that each child is different and has &nbsp;different potential.<br><br>

            &nbsp;To make learning beneficial we keep our method “child centric” knowing that each child is an individual with different talents and abilities hidden &nbsp;within. We need to unveil those.<br><br>

            &nbsp;True learning helps the child to handle stress, resolve conflict and control emotions, tools that are extremely necessary in today’s fast paced, &nbsp;demanding world.<br><br>

            &nbsp;Children today are living in challenging times and need to be mentored in a manner that will make them optimists, finding an opportunity in even &nbsp;the most adverse conditions. As adults, therefore we need to be there for them at all times, guiding them, encouraging them and rewarding them yet &nbsp;giving them the freedom to choose, to do and to be what they want and helping them to realise that Education is a continuous process and not just &nbsp;limited to the classroom.....<br><br>
 
Even as we impart education to match the advancement of technology and globalization we march our children ahead with DPS ethos of moral values and principles. It is natural to find in this ambience the intensive use of variety of thinking, activities, strategies and group dynamics so that our classrooms become alive.<br><br>

At DPS Gomtinagar Extension we aim to empower our students to grow as individuals with strong open discerning minds with an international perspective, preparing them to make a mark in the global village – the world has come to be today.<br><br>

Learning from international visits and attending international workshops / seminars will enable our students to experience and understand global scenario from a different cultural perspective. These brand ambassadors of DPS Gomtinagar Extension will strive to become global citizens moulded by the co-relatives of freedom and responsibilities. They will create a society of progressive, thinking individuals who will contribute to the intellectual development of the global community.<br><br>
